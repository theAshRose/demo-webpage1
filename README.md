## Description

This is a simple webpage in which I mastered HTML semantics and how they interact with CSS elements. I learned how to add proper notation, reduce redundancy in code, and fix a couple basic bugs. This was all done in the name of making the webpage accessible. Accesibility means that other developers and screen readers can navigate the webpage without having to do extra work.
